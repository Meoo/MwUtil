MwUtil
======

My utility library, offering mostly templatized classes.

This library is composed of inline and template classes, so it does not have to be compiled to be used.

MwUtil requires boost (http://www.boost.org/) to work.
If you want to compile the MwUtil's test program, you will have to compile boost's unit test framework.
